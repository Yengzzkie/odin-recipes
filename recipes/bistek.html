    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Bistek, short for "Bistek Tagalog," is a classic Filipino dish known for
      its mouthwatering combination of savory and tangy flavors. It typically
      consists of thinly sliced beef marinated in a mixture of soy sauce,
      calamansi (or lemon) juice, garlic, and pepper. The marinated beef is then
      pan-fried and simmered in the marinade, creating a delectable sauce.
      Bistek is often garnished with saut√©ed onions for added sweetness and
      texture. This dish is a favorite in Filipino cuisine and is commonly
      served with rice.
