    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Sinigang is a beloved Filipino soup known for its distinctive sour and
      savory flavor. It typically features a tamarind-based broth, which gives
      the soup its signature tangy taste. Sinigang can be made with various
      proteins like pork, shrimp, or fish, and it's often loaded with an
      assortment of vegetables like kangkong (water spinach), radish, eggplant,
      and okra. The combination of these ingredients results in a hearty and
      comforting dish that's a staple in Filipino cuisine. Sinigang is often
      served with steamed rice and enjoyed for its comforting and refreshing
      qualities.
